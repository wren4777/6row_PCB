# l420qmk
## A QMK-compatible controller for the Lenovo ThinkPad L420 Keyboard

Based on the excellent work by lowJ and his tp-keyboard project: https://github.com/lowJ/tp-keyboard

This project aims to create an easy-to-build **through-hole only** QMK-compatible controller for a ThinkPad keyboard and trackpoint, based on the ATMega324PA-PN microcontroller.
